## Yahtzee

The objective of the game is to score points by rolling five dice to make certain combinations.
You can roll the dice up to three times in a turn to make various scoring combinations.
A game consists of thirteen rounds. After each round, choose a scoring category for that round.
You get to use each category precisely once per game.

In the Upper Section of the scoring table (from "Aces" to "Sixes"), only dice showing a
certain number are taken into account for scoring. If you score 63 points or more in the
Upper Section, you get awarded a Bonus of 35 points.

As long as three or, respectively, four dice are the same, your score equals the sum of all dice
for categories Three Of A Kind and Four Of A Kind.
Full House (one set of three dice the same and the remaining two also the same) gets you 25 points.
Small Strait (four sequential dice) scores 30 points, Large Strait (five sequential dice) scores 40 points.
If all dice are the same, you have a Yahtzee, which is worth 50 points.
For Chance, anything goes and all dice count.
